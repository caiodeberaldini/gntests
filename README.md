# Graph Nets demos, tests and my own implementations

This is a repository of Deepmind's Graph Networks demos and some own implementations attempts. For more infos about graph nets check out this [link](https://github.com/deepmind/graph_nets).

## Installation

For this particular repository and those who are working with me, I strongly recommend installing or using a virtual env, due to TensorFlow and other libraries that have a few tricky installation problems. I also recommend having Python 3.4+ installed, although it works fine with Python 2.7.

Graph Nets library can be installed from pip. For using it with TensorFlow 2 and Sonnet 2, run:

(TensorFlow CPU version)
```shell
$ pip install -r cpu_requirements.txt
```

(TensorFlow GPU version)
```shell
$ pip install -r gpu_requirements.txt
```
